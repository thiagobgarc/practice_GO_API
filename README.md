# PRACTICE MONOREPOSITORY

This repository is a playground for practicing and honing my skills in building APIs with Go. Here, I'll create and experiment with multiple API projects, each serving as a practice exercise to explore different aspects of API development. The goal is to deepen my understanding of Go and build a solid foundation for creating RESTful and efficient APIs.

## Projects

Each API will be housed in its own folder within this repository, with documentation on the specific functionality, setup, and usage of each API.

Stay tuned as I continue to add more practice APIs to this monorepo!
